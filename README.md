# G2MoE: Granularity-Aware Graph Mixture-of-Experts for Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization
___
This repository contains the implementation of **G2MoE**, a novel framework for Vietnamese multi-document summarization. G2MoE combines heterogeneous graph-based text modeling with a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, where each expert is implemented using Graph Attention Networks. The model features a Holistic Expert for global context and Granularity-specific Experts for finer-grained semantic levels, enabling effective information synthesis from multiple documents in low-resource settings.
