# Granularity-Aware Mixture-of-Experts for Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization
___

This repository contains the implementation of **ViGAMoE**, a heterogeneous graph-based model that integrates a novel Mixture-of-Experts mechanism with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for Vietnamese text summarization. The model employs granularity-aware experts to capture structural information at sentence, section, and document levels, effectively balancing local coherence and global semantics within a unified graph attention framework.
